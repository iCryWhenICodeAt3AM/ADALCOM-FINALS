Types of Data Structures Used:
1.Minimum Spanning Tree
    1.1. Dynamic Data Structure: Object, DisjointSet
    -Object: Represents the nodes and edges of the Graph    
    -DisjointSet: Mainly used in Kruskal's Algorithm to keep track of the nodes connectivity
    1.2. Non-Linear Data Structure: Graph Data Structure and Algorithm
    -Application and Network Implementation using VIS.JS

2.Shortest Path
    2.1. Dynamic Data Structure: Object, Maps, Sets
    -Object: Represents the nodes and edges of the Graph
    -Maps: Implemented for node label identifier based on id
    -Sets: Mainly used in the Dijkstra's Algorithm to save visited nodes
    2.2. Non-Linear Data Structure: Graph Data Structure and Algorithm
    -Application and Network Implementation using VIS.JS

3.Tree Traversal
    3.1 Dynamic Data Structure: Maps, Sets
    -Maps: Used to represent the graph's adjacency list (node and its neighbors)
    -Sets: Used to track visited nodes during hamiltonian path traversal (avoidance of visiting nodes twice)
    3.2. Non-Linear Data Structure: Graph Data Structure and Algorithm
    -Application and Network Implementation using VIS.JS

4.Optimization Algorithm (Greedy Algorithm)
    4.1. Dynamic Data Structure: Object, Array
    -Object: The rowData object is used to store the properties of each table row, including code, profit, weight, selection, and profitPerWeight.
    -Array: The variables tableData and totalPriceArray are arrays used to store the table data and total price information, respectively.
