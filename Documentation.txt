Types of Data Structures Used:
1.Minimum Spanning Tree
    1.1. Dynamic Data Structure: Objects, DisjointSet
    -Objects: Represents the nodes and edges of the Graph    
    -DisjointSet: Mainly used in Kruskal's Algorithm to keep track of the nodes connectivity
    1.2. Non-Linear Data Structure: Graph Data Structure and Algorithm
    -Application and Network Implementation using VIS.JS

2.Shortest Path
    2.1. Dynamic Data Structure: Objects, Maps, Sets
    -Objects: Represents the nodes and edges of the Graph
    -Maps: Implemented for node label identifier based on id
    -Sets: Mainly used in the Dijkstra's Algorithm to save visited nodes
    2.2. Non-Linear Data Structure: Graph Data Structure and Algorithm
    -Application and Network Implementation using VIS.JS

3.Tree Traversal
    3.1 Dynamic Data Structure: Maps, Sets
    -Maps: Used to represent the graph's adjacency list (node and its neighbors)
    -Sets: Used to track visited nodes during hamiltonian path traversal (avoidance of visiting nodes twice)
    3.2. Non-Linear Data Structure: Graph Data Structure and Algorithm
    -Application and Network Implementation using VIS.JS
